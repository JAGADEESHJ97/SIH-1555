## 📝 Problem Description
Background: The AYUSH sector relies heavily on medicinal plants and herbs, which form the backbone of traditional healing practices. However, physical gardens that are not accessible to everyone. A Virtual Herbal Garden will bridge this gap by offering a digital platform where users can explore, learn, and understand the significance of various medicinal plants from the comfort of their homes. Description: Participants are tasked with developing a Virtual Herbal Garden that is engaging, informative, and user-friendly. This virtual garden should include: Interactive 3D Models: Realistic 3D models of medicinal plants that users can rotate, zoom, and explore from different angles. Detailed Information: Comprehensive details about each plant, including its botanical name, common names, habitat, medicinal uses, and methods of cultivation. Multimedia Integration: High-quality images, videos, and audio descriptions to enhance the learning experience. Search and Filter Options: Advanced search functionality to easily locate specific plants and filter them based on various criteria like medicinal uses, region, and type. Virtual Tours: Guided virtual tours highlighting specific themes, such as plants for digestive health, immunity, skin care, etc. User Interaction: Features that allow users to bookmark favourite plants, take notes, and share information on social media. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a comprehensive Virtual Herbal Garden that serves as a valuable educational tool for students, practitioners, and enthusiasts of the AYUSH sector. This platform should make the knowledge of medicinal plants accessible to a wider audience, promoting awareness and understanding of traditional herbal practices. It should be visually appealing, informative, and interactive, providing users with an immersive experience that combines technology with traditional knowledge.

### Background
